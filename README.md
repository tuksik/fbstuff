Pierre Yager announced on firebird-devel new version of UIB with Firebird 3.0 API support:

Thanks to Vlad, we achieved the translation of the FB3 OO API in UIB
Components for Delphi.

You can checkout the code from SourceForge repository :

Now, we only miss hints to deal with FbMessage, it seems that the
examples (fbstuff on github) made by Adriano heavily relies on BOOST
and as we donâ€™t have such possibilities with Delphi we must understand
what is exactly an FbMessage and see what we can do.
